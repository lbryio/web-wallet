This is an example app that communicates with the web wallet. It's also an angular app (for now).

Forked from https://github.com/deso-protocol/identity though most of it is gutted.

WIP. Still gutting DeSo, noting which parts we might need ourselves later, and which parts we should put our own stuff in its place.

TODO - instructions for running backend and frontend, in their own READMEs. And refer to both from this README. I'd do both here, but the frontend is angular, which has its own instructions already. Backend instructions should include running lbrycrd mainnet with `./lbrycrdd -server -noconnect`. Also, config.go
