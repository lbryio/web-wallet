## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server (this adds extra setup on top of mere `ng serve`). Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

After proper configuration of `environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts`, run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
